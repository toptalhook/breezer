IOT and blockchain makes it easy for a consumer to trust the food they eat or the medicine that they are taking,Using IOT data we can rate the crop and medicine for freshness parameters - like humidity,max temp and min temp over a span of time to name a few.
It is here to replace food safety licenses we use today.(more authentic with real time data)


We use the IOT data by Tru-stream as an example parameter and use it to make an nft that represents the rating patch for a pack of crops/medicine, also written a market contract so one can buy from marketplace

## What we doing:

- Collecting immense amounts of IoT devices data on a daily basis to predict rating of our farm and medical products
- Users can track position of their product, know the conditions in which they are kept and predict rating based on data
- we can mint our crop/medicine nft based on the data collected and put that on market for sale
- The nft represents the crop/medicine package and the rating assists customers in selecting the best product

It is an NFT market where you can create IOTEX-based ERC721-implemented breeze NFTs and manage them. IoT and blockchain give us the capability to use IOT data to rate the freshness parameters of crops and medicines using Tru-Stream and IOTEX.
